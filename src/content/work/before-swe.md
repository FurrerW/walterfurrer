Before my time at Minuteman Press, I honed my skills as a seasoned Customer Service Professional. Over the years, I've worn many hats in diverse customer-facing roles, from retail, to internal support, to B2B interactions.

Beyond my customer serivce experience, I've always been a team player and often found myself in leadership roles. Drawing inspiration from exceptional mentors, managers and coworkers, I've cultivated a strong foundation of both hard and soft skills. This has shaped not only my work ethic but also my approach to building and nurturing positive relationships with colleagues.
