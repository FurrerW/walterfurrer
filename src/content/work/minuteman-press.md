My goal is to provide exceptional service to our 1000+ franchise locations across the world. Although the scope of my work primarily revolves around the setup and functionality of our proprietary software, it does occasionally branch out into:

- Troubleshooting networking issues
- Configuring user permissions in Windows
- Creating documentation for end users
- Internal testing of new versions of our software
- Basic SQL queries in order to fix or edit franchise databases
